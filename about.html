<p>I was born in Senegal West Africa. I came to America at the age of 10 and have been here ever since. I'm also multi lingual; I speak wolof fluently and can read and write Arabic,  the language of code is currently on my agenda. I enjoy creating things, solving puzzles, and finding solutions to problems. My dream is to become a VR game developer and start my own business. I also love homemade banana pudding!! </p>
