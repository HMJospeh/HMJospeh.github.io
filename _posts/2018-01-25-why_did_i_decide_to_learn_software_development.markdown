**Why did I decide to learn software development**

 I decided to become a developer when I realized that manual labor wasn't the kind of work that would allow me to live up to my fullest potential. I enjoy challenging myself and pushing the limits of my mind. 
 
Growing up with a mother that is a computer engineer, I feel like it was always inside of me, but unrealized until my uncle shared his experience with the Coding bootcamp he finished in 2017. 
 
I also enjoy the ability to be able to create visual works of art, worlds, dimensions and helpful tools that could be used on a daily basis. 

My passion for becoming a developer burns deeply, I am happy I'm on this path. My only wish would be to have known that this is what I wanted to do sooner, but I believe everything happens in the season that is assigned for it, so I am thankful to be here now.
