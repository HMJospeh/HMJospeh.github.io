* Doing What I Love:

Upon completing my course in Coding, I intend to join a company with a great environment for growth and creativity where I can utilize the skills I acquired from Flatiron, as well as earn the income needed to give my family a comfortable lifestyle. 

* From Software Developer to VR Developer:

Once I establish myself in the Tech industry, I'd like to continue my education to acquire the knowledge and credentials to enter into the Virtual Reality industry. From this point, I will continue my journey into the world of character creation, programming on an massive multiplayer level, detailed story concepts, and multi-lingual implementation. I believe that these steps will be the foundation of attaining my ultimate goal.
 
* Create an Interactive VR Universe:

I feel that this step will be the most challenging to accomplish, for I know to create a universe, there will be a TON of coding to do... hopefuly after completing this course I will be able to start this project, even if it's just a small portion. I have an infinite amount of ideas, stories, and worlds that I want to create. I feel that now is the best time to begin...well, the understanding of Code comes first.
 
* Establish my Own Business

I'm currently working on the business plan for my company. I'd like to create a business centered around working remotely so that I'm able to support my family finacially and with my physical presence as much as possible. I'd like this business to center around helping people with solutions-based services.

* Five Year Target:

I intend to accomplish the completion of my Flatiron certificate program, I'd like to continue my education to earn a Master's degree in Computer Science, grow and expand my business, and acquire property to function as a headquarters for my business. I believe with the amount of effort and time that I will dedicate to achieve my goals, that within 5 years I will at least make headway with my VR universe Development project. I have no intentions on yielding to any obsticle in my way. I will achieve my goal.
